There are two zip files on this page:
http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~rarnold/public_files/

Rstress.zip
tab.zip

Unpack Rstress.zip and it will create a directory Rstress/ with a whole lot of
R code and a few subdirectories Upack tab.zip (it's large) and it will create a
directory tab/ with a set of binary files that R needs Move that tab/ directory
to make it a subdirectory of the Rstress directory.

You need to install R, and also install the add-on packages: "adapt" and "boot"
when you do so.

Once R is installed the code you need to run is in
drive_inversion.q
and
post_process.q

You need to put a .csv file in the Rstress/indata/ directory for every
inversion you want to do, and then edit drive_inversion.q so it know which
files to use.  There are two example files crete.csv and dixie.csv already
there, which you can run as examples.  Use the naming convention XXX.csv where
XXX is the name of the set of focal mechanisms.  Each .csv file needs
strike/dip/rake/error comma separated, one per line, all values in degrees.

Running the R code (which you can just copy and paste into R) will do the
inversion and create a whole lot of output files in Rstress/outdata/ They are
described in post_process.q If the output files have the information you need
then you may not need to run anything else (post_process.q just has code to
produce additional plots which you may want to use)
